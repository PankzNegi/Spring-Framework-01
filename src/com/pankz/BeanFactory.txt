In Spring Framework we have IoC container (Inversion of Control) which receives metadata from either an XML file, Java annotations, or Java code 
and works accordingly. 
IoC adds the flexibility and control of application, and provides a central place of configuration management for Plain Old Java Objects (POJO) of our application.





What is Bean Factory????
It is an interface defined in org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory.
Bean Factory provides the basic support for Dependency Injection.
It is based on factory design pattern which creates the beans of any type.
BeanFactory follows lazy-initialization technique which means beans are loaded as soon as bean factory instance is created but the beans are created only when getBean() method is called.
The XmlBeanFactory is the implementation class for the BeanFactory interface. To use the BeanFactory, you need to create the instance of XmlBeanFactory class as shown below:
BeanFactory beanFactory = new XmlBeanFactory(new ClassPathResource("beans.xml"));



When to use BeanFactory???

The BeanFactory is usually preferred where the resources are limited like mobile devices or applet based applications.
 So use an ApplicationContext unless you have a good reason for not doing so.
