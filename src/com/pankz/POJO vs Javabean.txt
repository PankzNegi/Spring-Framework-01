POJO: If the class can be executed with underlying JDK,without any other external third party libraries support then its called POJO

JavaBean: If class only contains attributes with accessors(setters and getters) those are called javabeans.
Java beans generally "will not contain any bussiness logic" rather those are used for holding some data in it.

All Javabeans are POJOs but all POJO are not Javabeans.

Pojo - Plain old java object

pojo class is an ordinary class without any specialties,class totally loosely coupled from technology/framework.the class does not implements from technology/framework and does not extends from technology/framework api that class is called pojo class.

pojo class can implements interfaces and extend classes but the super class or interface should not be an technology/framework.

Examples :

1.

class ABC{
----
}
ABC class not implementing or extending from technology/framework that's why this is pojo class.

2.

class ABC extends HttpServlet{
---
}
ABC class extending from servlet technology api that's why this is not a pojo class.

3.

class ABC implements java.rmi.Remote{
----
}
ABC class implements from rmi api that's why this is not a pojo class.

4.

class ABC implements java.io.Serializable{
---
}
this interface is part of java language not a part of technology/framework.so this is pojo class.

5.

class ABC extends Thread{
--
}
here thread is also class of java language so this is also a pojo class.

6.

class ABC extends Test{
--
}
if Test class extends or implements from technologies/framework then ABC is also not a pojo class because it inherits the properties of Test class. if Test class is not a pojo class then ABC class also not a pojo class.
